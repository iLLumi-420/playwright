    About

Jack Welch is one of the world's most respected and celebrated CEOs,
known for his unmatched track record of success, enormous love of
people, fierce passion for winning, and unbridled desire to change the
world for the better using his unique management practices, which are
collectively called The Welch Way.

In his 21 years as CEO, Jack transformed GE into the world's most
admired and successful company with his innovative management
techniques. Revenues grew five-fold from $25 billion to $130 billion,
income grew ten-fold, from $1.5 billion to $15 billion, and the
company's market capitalization had a 30-fold increase of more than $400
billion. His achievements are considered epic, and as a result,
thousands of companies around the world have adopted the Welch Way.

After retiring from GE in 2001, Jack Welch has only become more active
in business. He has written three best-selling business books, Jack:
Straight from the Gut, Winning, and The Real Life MBA. He actively
participates in managing numerous companies as part of a private equity
group, and for four years wrote an immensely popular weekly column for
BusinessWeek magazine. He is a fixture on TV as a popular business
commentator.

Jack has always been defined by his zealous love of teaching and
commitment to building leaders. At GE, he created the world's best
corporate training center and regularly taught there himself. More
recently, he taught a popular course as a visiting professor at MIT's
Sloan School of Management.

In 2010, Jack founded the Jack Welch Management Institute, a business
school that offers executive education and management training. Jack is
intimately involved in every aspect of the Institute. As Executive
Chairman, he hosts video conferences with students, appears in exclusive
videos about current business events and is deeply engaged in the
development of the program's curriculum.
