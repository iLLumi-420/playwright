These methods are now largely obsolete since they are limited to collecting broad types of data rather than precise items-- like the exact location or condition of specific products. IoT solutions can track products individually and obtain granular data like storage temperatures, time spent in transit, or days on the shelf. These granular insights into the supply chain coupled with cloud computing and data analytics can inform predictive models that allow for up-to-the-second delivery information, creating efficiencies across the stack in everything from delivery times, quality controls, staffing levels, product forecasting, and even security.&nbsp;\u003Ca href=\"https://techstars.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=23c2f3511250266b539c203d9&amp;id=891212c3ec&amp;e=c43cb504ae\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003EBlik\u003C/a\u003E,&nbsp;one of our portfolio companies, provides a&nbsp;unique&nbsp;approach to managing logistics operations by ensuring full transparency and real-time tracking of goods in the supply chain.\u003C/li\u003E \n   \u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EInventory &amp; Warehouse Management:\u003C/strong\u003E&nbsp;RFID tags, LPWANs, satellite trackers&nbsp;Bluetooth tags, beacons, and NFC all contribute to the evolving (and fragmented) solutions to inventory management.

Investor. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EAfter graduating law school and working in finance, I found myself falling in love with technology - first as a founder of two mobile software companies and now as an early stage investor. Being a founder was the most humbling and challenging work of my life, and I’ve channeled many of the learnings into my investment style.\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EI was the Managing Director at Techstars for 7.5 years where I led investments into companies that now have a market cap of over $10B, prior to co-founding the global venture capital firm, Everywhere Ventures. Across these entities, I’ve been the first-money into 300+ tech-enabled companies including: Chainalysis, Alloy, Latch, Tempo Automation, Headway, Supergreat, Contra, Particle Health, Pair Eyewear, Solo Funds, Halp, Minded, Rupa Health, Morty, Wagmo, Smarthop, PathSpot, Remesh, Cube, OnePipe, Season, Parsley Health and so many more: https://angel.co/jenny-fielding\u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EWhen I’m not investing, you can find me catching up with founders around the world or hanging out with my students at Columbia University and Cornell Tech where I’m an Adjunct Professor. \u003Cbr\u003E\u003Cbr\u003EBio / photos can be found here: https://www.jennyfielding.com/bio"},{"@type":"WebPage","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyfielding","reviewedBy":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jenny Fielding"}}]}

          <p>Founder. Operator. Investor. <br><br>After graduating law school and working in finance, I found myself falling in love with technology - first as a founder of two mobile software companies and now as an early stage investor. Being a founder was the most humbling and challenging work of my life, and I’ve channeled many of the learnings into my investment style.<br><br>I was the Managing Director at Techstars for 7.5 years where I led investments into companies that now have a market cap of over $10B, prior to co-founding the global venture capital firm, Everywhere Ventures. Across these entities, I’ve been the first-money into 300+ tech-enabled companies including: Chainalysis, Alloy, Latch, Tempo Automation, Headway, Supergreat, Contra, Particle Health, Pair Eyewear, Solo Funds, Halp, Minded, Rupa Health, Morty, Wagmo, Smarthop, PathSpot, Remesh, Cube, OnePipe, Season, Parsley Health and so many more: https://angel.co/jenny-fielding<br><br>When I’m not investing, you can find me catching up with founders around the world or hanging out with my students at Columbia University and Cornell Tech where I’m an Adjunct Professor. <br><br>Bio / photos can be found here: https://www.jennyfielding.com/bio</p>

          As a founder, if you are not failing often, you are probably being too conservative, not thinking big enough and may not be taking enough risk. While running my startup, we ran monthly product and marketing experiments on our quest towards finding product / market fit. As you can imagine, many of didn't work. But we viewed these failed experiments as a gift - sparing us from going deep down a dead-end path. The failed experiments also help the team build resilience and move faster. I see this in my current 'startup', my venture fund, where we've tried a number of experiments around building / engaging community that didn't pan out. Instead of dueling on these, we whiteboard a new list of ideas and get cracking on those.

        <p class="text-md leading-regular my-1 line-clamp-3">
          In my experience, the best way to build a great company culture across a highly distributed company is to ensure that employees in different locations all feel interconnected. To do this, establish smaller cross-location pods of talent and set up time / activities / content to connect them. So for example, add all the product managers to a 'PM pod' that meets bi-weekly to share challenges, wins and objectives. These activities can help unify the greater team and keep everyone on the same page. I used this strategy in my own distributed startup and it proved effective and relatively easy to administer.

          I don't believe that you should ask any investor that you are pitching for introductions to other investors until they have already committed to invest. If I get sent a deal from an investor who could invest, but did not, this is a negative signal and not helpful to the founder. Much better to get intros to investors from other founders, mentors, existing investors and others that believe in you and your business.

        <p class="text-md leading-regular my-1 line-clamp-3">
          The best way to follow up after an investor pitch is send an email showing how 1) the business has momentum and 2) the round is filling up. To do this effectively, you will have to wait until you have some positive markers (hopefully only a few days) A few examples of business momentum: key hire agreed to join, new customer closed, new product feature shipped, customer waitlist increased. This type of business momentum will have a huge impact on an investor who does not have conviction to invest yet but is leaning in. Similarly, as you gain commitments in your round, feed that back to the investor to show that the round is moving with or without his / her investment. It's human nature not to want to miss out on a great opportunity!

          My cofounder and I inevitably start our Monday morning team meeting with the phrase..."I have this crazy idea". At our fund, experimenting with new ideas is part of our culture (we are all startup founders by background) and we encourage taking risks and trying out new technologies and models. We have failed at many of the experiments but we celebrate those as helping get us closer to our objectives thru an iterative process.

          One great way to get to know a person before bringing them on as a cofounder or teammate is to work together on a part-time / consultative basis first. I've worked with many fantastic people who started off as consultants and then joined the team full time once we established that the fit was there. This can help both parties evaluate 1) skill set 2) cultural fit 3) working styles 4) shared vision / mission. 'Try before you buy' can be beneficial for everyone!
