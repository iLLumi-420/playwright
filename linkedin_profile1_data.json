    "about": "Founder. Operator. Investor.After graduating law school and working in finance, I found myself falling in love with technology - first as a founder of two mobile software companies and now as an early stage investor. Being a founder was the most humbling and challenging work of my life, and I\u2019ve channeled many of the learnings into my investment style.I was the Managing Director at Techstars for 7.5 years where I led investments into companies that now have a market cap of over $10B, prior to co-founding the global venture capital firm, Everywhere Ventures. Across these entities, I\u2019ve been the first-money into 300+ tech-enabled companies including: Chainalysis, Alloy, Latch, Tempo Automation, Headway, Supergreat, Contra, Particle Health, Pair Eyewear, Solo Funds, Halp, Minded, Rupa Health, Morty, Wagmo, Smarthop, PathSpot, Remesh, Cube, OnePipe, Season, Parsley Health and so many more: https://angel.co/jenny-fieldingWhen I\u2019m not investing, you can find me catching up with founders around the world or hanging out with my students at Columbia University and Cornell Tech where I\u2019m an Adjunct Professor.Bio / photos can be found here: https://www.jennyfielding.com/bio",
