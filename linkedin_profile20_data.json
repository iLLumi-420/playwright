    "about": "I'm President and Partner at Initialized Capital, an early-stage Venture Capital Firm with $1B assets under management. At Initialized I'm responsible for hiring and managing the team on both the investment and operations sides of the business. I invest in companies that have an intriguing product or design challenge, usually in the e-commerce marketplace, enterprise saas, and data science spaces. I also advise our portfolio companies on product strategy/roadmaps, product design and user research, how to build and manage teams, and how to resolve conflicts.I have been a product executive at several B2B and B2C startups, from early-stage to growth stage. Prior to Initialized I was Chief Product Officer at Reserve, an Expa-funded hospitality platform that connects restaurants and diners. I also founded a boutique consultancy where I delivered successful projects for companies like Apple, Twitter, Chase, Nordstrom and Starwood Hotels. Before that I helped create the User Experience practice at Sapient and helped open its Milan, Italy office.",
